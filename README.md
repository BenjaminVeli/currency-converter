### CurrencyFlow

## Resources

- **CurrencyApi** With the premium version of Currency API, I was able to make calls to all 186 currency types it offers.
- **Xe** Using the Xe URL, I obtained the complete list of flags needed to combine them with the CurrencyApi.

1. **Rename** `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. **Create an account** on CurrencyAPI (Premium version required).
3. **Copy and paste** your API key into the `.env` file.
